### Running a Basic Command Shell
This C++ command shell is designed to accept a one-line command argument in Bash from the user. The one-line argument consists of
multiple commands followed by connectors. Those connectors determine how the command is executed.

### Updates
Command shell now takes higher-order connectors such as parentheses into consideration. 

### Known bugs

We are unable to work the exit command. Also, cannot run executable through the bin/rshell. The program must be made and ran through the ../src directory of rshell. There are no tags for the program so there only way to run the program is exactly through the installation provided.
